  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * [d79cc9d] d/control: fix postinst missing lsmod/modprobe.
    Upgrades on open-vm-desktop can trigger errors like the following:
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/open-vm-tools-desktop.postinst: 5:
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/open-vm-tools-desktop.postinst: lsmod: not found
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/open-vm-tools-desktop.postinst: 6:
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/open-vm-tools-desktop.postinst: modprobe: not found
    The reason is that kmod isn't a dependency of open-vm-tools-desktop and
    could be missing e.g. if you installed it in a system container.
    Once might discuss how useful open-vm-tools-desktop is in that
    environment but a n issue to fix none the less.

  * [4d3f25f] Fix guest OS reporting for Debian/Buster.

    Reason is the output of lsb_release, which outputs:
    $ lsb_release -sd

    But the code in open-vm-tools expects '10.'.

open-vm-tools (2:10.3.5-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * [71b468f] make vgauth service execution more reliable.
    Since d3d47039 "Start vgauth before vmtoolsd" there is a potential race
    of starting vgauth so early that it might have issues. This was
    discussed back in the day in [1] to [2], but confirmed to be ok by
    VMWare.
    We were all somewhat convinced by this, but a bad feeling remained not
    only with me but also with Bernd [4].
    A recent SRU review denial made me rethink all of it and I think we can
    make it safer without thwarting the purpose of the original change.
    Note: Disambiguation of service names used below:
    vgauth     - open-vm-tools.vgauth.service
    vmtoolsd   - open-vm-tools.service
    fs         - systemd-remount-fs.service
    tmp        - systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service
    cloud-init - cloud-init-local.service
    Currently we have these dependency requirements:
    - vgauth should be before vmtoolsd
    - cloud init should be before vmtoolsd
    - cloud init has to be really early in general
      - therefore this is using DefaultDependencies=No
    That lead to this graph:
     fs / tmp -> vmtoolsd -> cloud-init
    And d3d47039 added it to be like:
     fs / tmp -> vmtoolsd -> cloud-init
                   ^
     vgauth      --|
    But there is no need to have vgauth without any pre-dependencies at all.
    It is only needed to be "before" vmtoolsd, therefore we can make it:
     fs / tmp -> vgauth -> vmtoolsd -> cloud-init
    That will make execution of vgauth much less error-prone (even though I
    have no hard issue to report) while at the same time holding up all
    known required ordering constraints.

  * [d3d4703] Start vgauth before vmtoolsd.
    VGAuthService needs to be ready when vmtoolsd runs. Certain cases - e.g.
    Site Recovery Manager failover - will need vgauth to be up.
    Therefore add an After=vgauth.service dependency to open-vm-tools.service
    To have vgauth be able start early - and not pull cloud-init back late - it
    is also required to drop default dependencies which according to VMware is
    fine to do so.

    10.1.5 is a point release fixing the following issues:
    - Authentication failure is reported as unknown general system error.
      Attempts to authenticate through VGAuth service might result
      in an authentication-specific error such as an expired account or
      password. The authentication-specific error might then be incorrectly
      reported as an unknown general system error, similar to the following:
      CommunicationException: Failed to create temp file on target
      <IP_ADDRESS>: A general system error occurred: Unknown error

    - Unable to backup virtual machines with active Docker containers.
      This bug should not happen in Debian stretch at all, but might
      be relevant for backports.

    - Fix ISO mappings for CentOS/OracleLinux. Not relevant for Debian

  * Non-maintainer upload to ensure open-vm-tools will
    be shipped with Wheezy.
  * Ensure upgrades to not fail due to the broken init script
    (Closes: #686200)
    - Fix open-vm-tools init script to stop vmtoolsd properly.
    - Handle upgrades from a version with broken init script.
      Try to stop again, just in case. Ignore errors as we don't know
      how successful the old buggy script was.
  * Remove the duplicate vmware-suid-wrapper from open-vm-toolbox.
    The better way would be to ship it in open-vm-toolbox instead of
    open-vm-tools, but to avoid moving config files from one package
    into another we will keep it this way for Wheezy. Partly addresses
    #686202.
  * Handle binNMU/nmu/backports/... version numbers.

    on binNMU/nmu/security/... version numbers. Fixing this.
