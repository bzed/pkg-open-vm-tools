The files in this directory are the source files for the VMware
Memory Control driver.  The driver will be built automatically
by the VMware Tools install script.  If you wish to build the
driver by hand, run the following commands:

	make
        make install
        
from this directory.  The module 'vmmemctl.ko' will be built and
installed in /modules.
