 * the Linux client converts HGFS_STATUS_GENERIC_ERROR to -EIO, which causes

 * This is provided for convenience, since clients will need to copy both
 * the command and the space into some buffer that is then sent over the
 * backdoor.

 * endpoint is RpcIn. TCLO is a particularly confusing name choice which dates
 * back to when the host was to send raw TCL code to the guest (TCL Out ==
 * TCLO).

 * endpoint is RPCI.
